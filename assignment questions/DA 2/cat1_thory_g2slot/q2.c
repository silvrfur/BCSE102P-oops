/*
The temperature in Chennai exists somewhere between 280C to 330C in a particular 
week. The temperature in Delhi is 8
0C lesser than in Chennai. Likewise, the 
temperature in Haveri is 5
0C more than that of Chennai. Write a C program to find the 
temperature of Gangtok for a particular week, which is the temperature difference 
between Delhi and Haveri. Get the temperature of Chennai (
0C) as input for the week 
of 7 days and the temperature of Gangtok (
0C) as output for the week of 7 days. 
Implement the program using arrays and validate the rules.
